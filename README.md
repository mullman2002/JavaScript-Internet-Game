This repository was created for a contribution to a student project. 

The student approached me with a web based game that they needed help with. 
They needed to be able to have a user click a link, that had an associated 
point value to that link. The point sum would be saved until the user had 
made a total of five choices. After five choices the user's score would be 
compared to a bench mark score to deterimine win or loss of game.

At anytime the user can click a reset button which brings the user back to
start page, and resets all point values to zero.

I'm not terribly fluent in JavaScript, but after some searching I discovered
the localStorage[] approach and was the easiest/cleanest way I found to solve
this problem.

End result, webiste worked as desired, and student was very happy.
