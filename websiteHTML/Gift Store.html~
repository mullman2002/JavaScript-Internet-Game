<p>The player should be able to select 1 of the 4 options via a SUBMIT button. Once the player hits the submit button, it should take him to either a customized acknowledgement page or the &quot;end.html&quot; page. If the player has completed 5 errands or less from the home page, then he should be directed to a customized acknowledgement  page (where he is allowed to click a button to continuing playing). Once he completes 5  errands, he should be directed to the &quot;end.html&quot; page, instead of the customized acknowledgment page.</p>
<p>The game must keep track of the points/numerial values choosen by the player and then total up the points/numerial values at the end and display the final number. </p>

(The &quot;Start a New Game&quot; link/button should take the player back to the home page, but it needs to clear/reset the game back to zero points so the player can start again with a clean slate.)</p>
